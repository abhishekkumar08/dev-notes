- GraphiQL - GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). It is a tool that helps to query and mutate GraphQL data cleanly and easily. It has features like syntax highlighting, Intelligent type ahead of fields, arguments, types, real-time error highlighting and reporting an automatic query completion.

- GraphQL Schema - A GraphQL schema is at the center of any GraphQL server as it helps describes the functionality available to the clients that connect to it. GraphQL queries are used by the client to request the data it needs from the server while a GraphQL mutation is a way of creating, updating and deleting existing data.

- GraphQL - GraphQL is an open-source query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It enables front-end developers to write queries that return the exact data you want. It uses a syntax that describes how to ask for data and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL is language-agnostic as it can work with any server-side language. GraphQL aims to speed up development, improve the developer experience and offer better tooling. Itâ€™s often seen as an alternative to REST when building web applications.
